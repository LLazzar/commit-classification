## Scripts

-  `Commit_Classification.ipynb` is the main notebook, it goes through everything that's been done in the paper <br />
-  `text_data_preprocessing` contains some auxillary code need in `Commit_Classification.ipynb` <br />
-  `Extra_fasttext_paper_model_VS_logit_final_model` a little extra, it goes through a comparison between the trained Logit model in `Commit_Classification.ipynb` and the fasttext model trained by the authors of the paper (that can be found [here](https://github.com/gesteves91/fasttext-commit-classification)). The models are put to work on the unlabelled dataset `commits.csv` that can be found in the data folder.
